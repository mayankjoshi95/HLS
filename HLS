A SOFTWARE FUNCTION DESCRIBE HARDWARE MODULE 
THE FUNCTION ARGUMENT MODEL THE HARDWARE PORTS 
A FUNCTION BODY IMPLEMENTS HARDWARE BEHAVIOUR 


TO USE THE HARDWARE PORTS 

void ledonoff(unsigned char*o)
{*o=0b11110000
}
port and function interfaces 
void ledonoff(unsigned char*o)
{
#pragmaHLS INTERFACE AP_NONE  PORT=o                                 ##AS WE DON'T HAVE ANY SPECIFIC INTERRFACE IN THIS EXAMPLE AP_NONE is used for this purpose 
#pragmaHLS INTERFACEAP_CTRL_NONE PORT=return                                                                   ##there is also an interface assigned to this whole function 

*o=0b11110000
}


In vivado HLS we 
1.Create a project 
2.add a source file 
3.perform high level synthesis
4.generate IP

TOP FUNCTION :IS THE NAME OF THE HARDWARE MODULE ENTRY FUNCTION .EACH HARDWARE MOPDULE HAVE ON TOP FUNCITON


VIVADO HLS GUI HAS 4 PARTS 

1st has EXPLORER it has includes which is the included header file 
2. source 
3.test bench 



void basic_output(unsigned char*o){
	*o=0b11110000;
}

#Now we should add pragma 
1.adding manually to the source code 
2. use directive 

void FIRST(unsigned char *o){
#pragma HLS INTERFACE ap_none port=o
#pragma HLS INTERFACE ap_ctrl_none port=return
	*o=0b11110000;
}
after it use synthesis and RTL .
we will get the ip then open vivado go to create design and after right click import the ip then click on the plus sign and add the IP .L
there are two pragma 
1.top level function pragma which add the control signal to the synthesized hardware.
2.Port related pragma  
since currently our design is simple thus these two group of pragma doesnot define the right interface.


DESIGN IN VIVADO 


LVCMOS33 
3.3 V LOW VOLTAGE CMOS SINGLE ENDED I/O STANDARD 
TO CONNECT THE IP PORTS INTO THE FPGA PINS ,WE SHOULD DEFINE SOME CONSTRAINTS 
THE MAIN CONSTRAINTS DETERMINE THE PIN LOCATION AND PIN ELECTRICAL STANDARD
